        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            ALBATROSS is a Kolkata-based merchandise exporting organization, catering to clients across Asia and South Asian countries. 
            Incorporated in 2003 by Mr. Samar Ganguly and Mrs. Biswarupa Ganguly (proprietor), it began by exporting 10 CNG models of Bajaj Auto to Chittagong, Bangladesh. 
            Over the years, it has expanded into construction equipment, building materials, and now manufactures wiremesh and allied products. 
            Albatross has consistently served companies in Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, building its reputation through product quality, sales and post-sales service, and on-time delivery.
            We believe our clients have built us, and we are committed to integrity, honesty, and loyaltyâ€”our core business mantras.
